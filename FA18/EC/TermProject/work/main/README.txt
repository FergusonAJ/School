To compile this code requires the Empirical library. 
https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical

Empirical is not included by default as it would swell the filesize of the repo and also requires third party applications also be installed. 

Please note that the code in this repository is not guaranteed to work with the latest version of Empirical. 

Once Empirical is downloaded andi the necessary third party software is in place, to compile this code it should be as simple as making sure the base Empirical directory contains the work and CellularAutomata directories from this repository. 


For example, the file structure should look like
Names with a * at the end are from this repository. 

./EmpiricalFolder
    ./apps
    ./CellularAutomata*
    ./doc
    ./examples
    ./Planning
    ./source
    ./tests
    ./third-party
    ./work*
        ./main*
            ./README.txt* (THIS FILE)
            ./src*
            ./etc


If you wish to compile or just want an executable, just ask Austin!
