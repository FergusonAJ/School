This entire repository is a mess composed of messy code. 
(Rushing the code does that)

Here is a list of the main files, ./ refers to the main/work/ directory where this file is saved.


Main files for each treatment:
./src/CA_Control.cc
./src/CA_Classic.cc
./src/CA_Quads.cc
./src/CA_Stripes.cc


Configuration file with many outdated options:
./config.txt


Header files that define organisms and their functions for each treatment:
./src/OrganismShared.hh
./src/Control.h
./src/Classic.h
./src/Quads.h
./src/Stripes.h


The main guts of everything to do with cellular automata. 
This code actually started out decent, but as time went on the quality quickly plummeted. 
It is also very scarcely commented. This is because I actually plan on returning to really clean up this code (See giant chunks currently commented out). I can go through and comment it all if you would like. 
../../CellularAutomata/CellularAutomaton.h

./viz/ holds the visualization scripts used, but a fair warning they are not commented at all.
